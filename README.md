This repo contains run_analysis.R, TidyData.txt and Codebook.md.

1. run_analysis.R
  (1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  (2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  (3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  (4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  (5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. TidyData.txt
  This is the final data file created by the run_analysis.R

3. Codebook.md
  Codebook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that I performed to clean up the data
